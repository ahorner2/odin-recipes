        <h3>Easy Pizza Crust</h3>

              <li>3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
              <li>2 (.25 ounce) envelopes FLEISCHMANN'S® Pizza Crust Yeast or RapidRise® Yeast</li>
              <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
              <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
              <li>1 ⅓ cups very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li>
              <li>⅓ cup oil</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Toppings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) package HORMEL® Pepperoni</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>
       <h2>Directions</h2>
         <ol>
             <li>Step 1</li>
                 <p>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water
                     in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while
                     making crust. Freeze remaining paste.</p>
             <li>Step 2</li>
                 <p>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast,
                     sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well
                     blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining
                     flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</p>
             <li>Step 3</li>
                 <p>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough
                     is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed.
                     (If using RapidRise® Yeast, let dough rest, covered,
                     for 10 minutes.)</p>
             <li>Step 4</li>
                 <p>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands)
                     into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit
                     pans.</p>
             <li>Step 5</li>
                 <p>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
                     Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</p>
             <li>Step 6</li>
                 <p>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and
                     cheese is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans
                     between top and bottom oven racks halfway
                     through baking.</p>
